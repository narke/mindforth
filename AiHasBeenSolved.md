### Eureka ###

To say that AI Has Been Solved is a pithy, dramatic way
of saying two things at once -- that the GrandChallenge of AI
was a problem for the human intellect, and that a solution
was found to the problem qua problem.

### PreHistory ###

The development of an AI BrainTheory was the main component of the solution
to AI, because nobody could build an AiMind without having a theory of how
the mind works. Having solved AI in BrainTheory, MentiFex naively thought
that all he had to do was tell the world about the solution, and
forthwith one AiMind after another would get built by modern industrial
society. What MentiFex was not counting on was the suppression of
new ideas by the clubby AiEstablishment and the next-to-impossible
difficulty of getting intelligent human beings to understand the complex
solution-ideas that were vexingly difficult to come up with in the first place.
The IndependentScholar MentiFex submitted the solution-in-theory
to a series of scientific journals and was rejected by one journal
after another for always a different reason. Since the initial rejection
was for the solution being speculative, the last straw, that broke
all patience with journals, was rejection by a journal calling itself
"Speculations in Science and Technology." But when MentiFex, having
solved AI on his own, decided to tell the world about it on his own
with or without the help of journal editors, he then learned that
Einstein was right in saying that new ideas are treated badly by
mediocre minds.


### BackLash ###

It was a real CatchTwentyTwo, Joe. Everybody knew that AI was too
hard a problem to solve, and so therefore, the more you insisted that
you had solved AI, the more evidence you were displaying of your own
pledge membership in the Kook-of-the-Month Club. MentiFex gradually
realized that it was not enough to solve AI in theory; it was also
necessary to solve AI in software -- with a working, thinking AiMind.
So MentiFex set about coding Amiga MindRexx in July of 1993 and told
UseNet about it in November of 1994 when the AiMind thought its first
thought. Ho hum, was the response of the general InterNet -- except
for the Forth programming community of CompLangForth on UseNet --
where there was a flurry of initial excitement.


### Proof ###

After several false starts in Forth on the Amiga 1000 computer,
MentiFex decided to spend the year 1998 translating (porting)
MindRexx to MindForth. The creation of MindForth as TrueAi took
not just one year, but ten years -- bringing us up to 2008.
Meanwhile, however, most of the Forth community had given up
on MentiFex and MindForth, making both entities the butt of
jokes and the subject of MentifexBashing testimonials about
what a NetKook MentiFex was.
