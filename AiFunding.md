### Shoestring ###

The most primitive level of AI Funding is at the extremes of individual vis-a-vis teamwork; youth vis-a-vis maturity; and low net-worth vis-a-vis opulence. If you are a student or an IndependentScholar wanting to work on AI with minimal funding, there are ways to do it.

- Work on some DayJob to finance your AiProject.

- Use second-hand computer hardware to save money.

- Use OpenSource software to create OpenSource AI.


### PreSolution ###

If you do not think that AiHasBeenSolved and you are eager to solve the problem of AI, then your opportunities for AI funding consist mainly of having the proverbial DayJob to support your efforts. Try to achieve some overlap between the DayJob and the AiProject. For instance, if your DayJob involves computers, you may learn things and gain access to things useful for your AiProject.


### PostSolution ###

If you accept the assumption that AiHasBeenSolved with MindForth and its derivative implementations, then you already have a positive MindSet that may enable you to generate AI Funding for your own career at the dawn of AiEvolution. Consider the following options for generating CashFlow while you advance the StateOftheArt in AI.

  * You let it be known that, for a very small fee, you will install a customized AiMind in JavaScript on the WebSite or LapTop or DeskTop of whoever wants to have an AI with a unique KnowledgeBase -- that you will code for your grateful and appreciative client.

For example, if a friend of yours wants an AiMind to liven up a WebSite, you code the DoxoLogy of your friend right into the inerasable KnowledgeBase. Then you seed the MindModule of KbTraversal with particular concepts that will engender thoughts and ideas telling websurfers interesting tidbits about your illustrious friend. For instance, you pre-ordain that KbTraversal will activate either the TrueName or the NickName of your friend as a ConCept lodged in the vault of the innate KnowledgeBase. Then periodically, when things are otherwise quiet due to lack of InterAction between HumanUser and AiMind, the CustomAi will suddenly think outloud the name of your friend with either a statement of fact or a question of inquiry. People all over the world who have clicked on the AiMind link and now have your friend's CustomAi up on their screens, will be treated to a revelation of the wondrously special nature and all-around excellence of your friend (or corporate client). Subjects dear to the heart of your friend may also be concepts reactivated by your coding of KbTraversal. Suppose, for instance, that your friend or business client is especially interested in, nay, totally fascinated by the concept of extended warranties and service contracts. All you as an AiCoder have to do is prime the KbTraversal module to rotate through the conceptual activation and thought-generation of ideas about the concepts of "warranty" and "service". The AiMind will bring up each engineered topic, and users will have the opportunity to make statements or ask questions about each topic of thought. If you code "roses" into the KbTraversal as something to think about, people who love roses (all those people in Pasadena CA and Portland OR) may "hang out" at your friend's WebSite to talk about roses with the artificial AiMind. Along the way, money will flow your way to fund your noble efforts in AiEvolution.

  * For a teensy-weensy fee, you install an AiMind in somebody's RoBot.

Most RoBotics club members are more interested in HardWare than in SoftWare. They like hands-on experience with making things go. You, however, are a more contemplative type and you are more interested in the ultimate mysteries of mind and thought. You let it be known that you would love to install an AiMind in somebody's robot for a ridiculously small fee -- just enough to pay for your daily coffee and your subscription to ArtificialGeneralIntelligence Magazine. It is a match made in AiHeaven, as your friend or client plies you with cash to keep up the good work of adding just one more feature to the AI Synapture of the insipient RoBot.

In either of the above choices, building up an AiMind for a small fee can lead to a BigTime career in BigAi.
