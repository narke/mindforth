### What is thought? ###

In an artificial or natural mind, thought is the conscious
process of naming or imagining concepts in a chain of association
by SpreadingActivation from concept to concept.

Because thinking is a conscious activity, each thought emerges as
a separate reality from, and as an addition to, the KnowledgeBase
(KB) which provides the fuel for thought. A knowledge base
in an artificial general intelligence (AGI) is not a static
compendium of facts and relationships, but is rather a dynamic,
constantly shifting grid of conceptual identifiers (words; images)
and the growing body of propositions asserting relationships
among the concepts.


### How does an AGI think? ###

Spreading activation becomes thought in an AGI if a
linguistic superstructure "rides the wave" of associations
and consciously names each concept in the chain of association.
In the SubConscious mind, activation spreads not as thought but
as a backdrop to emerging thought. The unity of mind and
ConSciousness -- the unity instantiated as self -- requires
that only one thought at a time expresses itself as ideation
above the teeming, roiling caldron of concepts and memories
clamoring for the attention of consciousness.


### Embodied thought ###

If every AGI were created not simply on a computer _qua_ computer
but on a computer _qua_ brain of a robot, the sensorium and
motorium of the robot would make it easier to initiate and
sustain each thought emerging from the conceptual MindGrid.
Sensory input would spark the activation of concepts and
their attendant images, engendering a stream of thought
amid the stream of consciousness.

If the robot-builders of this world can be thought of as
cowboys, and if the AGI entrepreneurs in many ways are farmers,
then the cowboys and the farmers should be friends. The cowboys
with their monstrous, clanking contraptions must be thinking,
"If I only had a brain." The farmers, with their SeedAi and
their server farms, are afraid that people will say they're in love.

In both cases, especially amateur robotics and amateur AGI,
lack of funding prevents holy MatrixMoney between the ghost in
the machine and robotic embodiment. Therefore the first thoughts
of the first True AGI specimens occur in computers bereft of bodies.


### Disembodied thought ###

If we may use MindForth as an example because MindForth has
already achieved thought, we see that disembodied thought
must contend with a unique set of problems and circumstances.
Whereas a RoBot has the world at its disposal for the
initiation and maintenance of a MeanderingChain of thought,
an AGI with no body has only user input to start the chain of
associations flowing in a manifestation of thought.
"Good enough," you might think, but what happens to the
conscious thinking of the AGI if the human user walks away
from the keyboard and stops entering input? What we have
here is a failure to communicate, which can cause failure
in the primitive AGI. MindForth compensates for the absence
of a human thought-provoker by means of a special mind-module
for knowledge base traversal. KbTraversal kicks in after a set
period of no outside communication, and reactivates concepts
held in the English bootstrap of the AGI Forthmind. KbTraversal
does not reactivate thoughts. It only reactivates various
concepts which may serve as the triggering mechanism for a
wide variety of thoughts, depending on the contents of the KB.

Other mechanisms to facilitate disembodied thought may include
an AGI feature of asking a question about any new word entered
by the human user but not yet known to the emerging AGI. Such a
question-asking mechanism is not so arbitrary and needlessly
artificial as it may seem. When the MindForth AGI encounters
a previously unknown English noun, it tries to generate a
sentence of thought using the new noun as the subject of the
sentence. For instance, upon first introduction of "books," it
may say, "BOOKS... WHAT ARE BOOKS?" The first instance of
"BOOKS" is actually the attempted generation of a sentence,
the formation of a thought in the artificial mind. But the
thought fails and is aborted, because SpreadingActivation
cannot flow from "BOOKS" to any verb known in association
with "BOOKS". Then a special module kicks in to ask a
a question about the mysterious new word. Such a module
facilitates achieving one of the "Holy Grail" goals of
AGI -- MachineLearning (ML).
