### Introduction ###

The MindForth cognitive architecture seeks to replicate the functionality
of the human brain as modelled in the BrainTheory documents. It is a
TopDown architecture, as opposed to a BottomUp architecture. The "top"
of the AI Mind in Win32Forth is the conscious thinking of the machine
intelligence. Somewhat lower than the topmost levels of thought are
the derivatives of thought, such as FreeWill and MotorOutput, as well
as the ingredients of thought, such as SensoryInput and EmotiOn.

Whereas other approaches, such as the
[SOAR cognitive architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soar_(cognitive_architecture))
may specifically address ProblemSolving as a feature, in MindForth
ProblemSolving is regarded as an emergent property which the
evolving AI Mind must grow into. Take for instance the playing
of the game of chess. MindForth will not be programmed to play chess,
but will only _learn_ to play chess as part of general experience.
Likewise take RecursiveSelfImprovement. MindForth will not be
programmed to write computer programs, but will only _learn_ to
write computer programs at an advanced stage of its general education.

The illustrious and ambitious
[TexAi project](http://www.texai.org/blog/?cat=21)
has among its lofty goals
the idea that TexAi quite early on shall try to write programs, with
a view to hastening the process of RecursiveSelfImprovement.
That approach is somewhat like expecting automobiles to manufacture
automobiles, and is more characteristic of a BottomUp approach as
found in genetic algorithms than a TopDown approach as found in MindForth.
Or it is like expecting children to go not into KinderGarten but
directly into medical school, without all the gradual accumulation
of experience and knowledge that a med student needs.

RecursiveSelfImprovement in AiEvolution does not mean that an
AI entity shall re-write the source code of its own "living" software
and suffer the consequences of mistakes and blunders. Rather,
an advanced AI Mind, having learned to program, will inspect
its own source code and try to replicate itself with minor
improvements. If multiple pathways of improvement open up,
multiple instances of replication will occur. Then each
non-faltering, successful MindChild will have the opportunity
to make further improvements and further replications --
_ad libitum et ad Singularitatem_.


### EmBodiment ###

The full cognitive architecture of MindForth requires RoBot
EmBodiment for expansion beyond the central mindcore of symbolic
thinking in natural language. A robot sensorium and a robot
motorium are necessary for the construction in software of the
AI-Complete architecture.
