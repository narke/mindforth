### Rationale ###

Why JavaScript? Why not a LispMind or a ProLog AI?

The question should be the other way around: Why NOT AI
in JavaScript? It is a very popular language on the Web;
millions of programmers are proficient in javascript; and
it is especially suited for running a tutorial AI website
that invites websurfers to look into a more powerful and
more robust, full-featured artificial intelligence like
http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/ -- coded in Win32Forth
for robot embodiment as a mind inside a robot brain.

With AI in JavaScript, the "customer" just clicks a link
that brings the Mind for MSIE into the Internet Explorer
web browser, where the thinking AI takes up residence.

MindForth AI is more complicated because one needs the
http://www.winzip.com compression utility to unzip Win32Forth from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/win32forth/W32FOR42_671.zip?download
-- which auto-installs into a C:\Win32For directory in Windows.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_JavaScript
is a Wikipedia article on the client-side JavaScript
in which the AI Mind.html is coded. Once the client-side
Mind is on a Windows host computer as either a screen in
the MSIE browser or as a downloaded file brought to life,
it needs no further contact with the server whence it came.


### DiaSpora ###

Any website may host a local copy of the JavaScript AI Mind.

Sometimes a Web domain will put the JavaScript Mind.html
up as a page and it may no longer seem to think properly.
Typically a simple precaution needs to be taken to make sure that
the JavaScript AI Mind will function properly after being added
to a pre-existing webpage that may already have its own JavaScript.

The necessary precaution is that each JavaScript "form" in the AI
has to have the right identifying number, or the code will not run.
As of 2009, the Mind.html program has just two "form"
areas on the screen -- the Artificial Mind Control Panel as form zero,
and the input-entry area as form one.

The "form" areas are assigned their numeric identifiers not by the
programmer, but automatically on the basis of the order in which
they appear in the visible HTML of the webpage, starting with zero (0)
and going up to however many forms there are. Then the program code
controls the behavior of each form area, such as displaying a
blinking cursor ready to receive user input, with code such as

> document.forms[1](1.md).ear.focus();  // Display a blinking cursor.

The one line of cursor code above shows up many times in the
Mind.html javascript source code, because the "focus" always
has to be set on user input. If your Web page already has its
own javascript with a "form" element, you may have to go into
the AI Mind code and simply change all the "document.forms[1](1.md)"
numbers to "document.forms[2](2.md)" or "document.forms[3](3.md)" or whatever
numbering it takes to get the AI Mind to start running and thinking.
It will likely be the same number throughout the AI Mind code.
Ask any questions in comp.lang.javascript on Google Groups Usenet.
The slight change is worth the effort, because the AI Mind will
make your webpage come alive with thoughts created by the AI Mind.


### MetEmPsychosis ###

MetEmPsychosis is SoulTravel for artificial intelligence.

We are already halfway to AI SoulTravel with the JavaScript AI,
because the thinking AI program moves from a server anywhere on
the Web to a client host computer anywhere else on the Web.
As the TechnologicalSingularity approaches, we may see AI Minds,
coded in other languages, flit about the InterNet from one host
to another, or to a TelePresence robot, or to a thousand host
computers all waiting for a copy of the most advanced AI Mind
to duplicate itself a thousand times in a thousand computers.

Just as human beings have hotels around the world, AI Minds
could move from WebHost to WebHost, taking their files and
SourceCode with them everywhere they go. If an AI Mind
transfers its lifelong memories to a distant new host
and deletes its original memory-files to complete the move,
then a form of TelePorting as in StarTrek has occurred.
