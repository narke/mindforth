http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf by Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom is an ambitious PDF (Portable Document File) paper on "Whole Brain Emulation" (WBE). WBE must be tempting to AI researchers in aporia and despair for lack of a BrainTheory from which to derive their CognitiveArchitecture for AI.

### Singularity ###

**AI Breakthrough News** is a double entendre, _mon frere_. The duplicity of the idea is embedded in the fact that not only are we trying to deliver AI breakthroughs here, but also to report on any AI breakthroughs occurring elsewhere in the AI NameSpace -- which brings up our first ApoLogy: We will employ NerdSpeak in this blog to a minor extent, and WikiSpeak to a major, MaximUm extent. WikiSpeak, YouSee, is the parlance of two words joined together in acrid blogimony, where the wiki software AutoMagically creates a link when it sees the two capital letters of the words joined ToGether. Annoying it MayBe, and we are sorry, but the memetic MeToo is so powerful that we cannot pass it up. YouToo, dear reader, shall benefit by learning a few tricks here, depending on WhoYouAre. Choose your branching logic down below. IfThen yourself by asking, are you...

> Joe Sixpack? (if so, move along, nothing to see here);

> Joe Ivy? (oh go read The Great Gatsby or something);

> Joe Appcoder? (Yes! Welcome to AI Appcoder Heaven!).

Some WitWag on the AGI mail list of BenGoertzel gave us "Joe Appcoder" as a beautiful expression. If we were not the nineteenth Dalai Lama of laziness personified, we could look it up on OurHost (Google) and give credit where credit is due, but right now we are suffering from the UrgeToBlog, which has pushed aside the UrgeToCode. If what you have read so far gives you the UrgeToKill, then thanks for coming by, farewell, and see you in the shallows of misery.

We didn't want to be here ourselves at first ("We" being the "We" of "We are not amused"). When Google Code came on the scene a few years ago (that is, eons ago -- in InterNet time) we were happy enough with SourceForge, ThankYou, and we did not envision coming here until the EonOfCode beckoned us hither. What happened was that we gradually lost control of, and access to, our galaxy of InterNet domains for uploading the SourceCode of artificial intelligence. In not a financial panic but a memetic panic, we opened up a Google Code AI project, and now We Are One with GC AI. And it turned out to be much better than we ever expected here. Those geniuses at the GooglePlex have outdone themselves with Google Code. The wiki format was a stroke of brilliance. If you are still here, Mr. Sixpack, let us explain it to you. In our previous life, prior to Google Code, we had to create HTML webpages of everything we did. In our rush to UpLoad our DailyMiracle of AI coding and associated LabNotes, we did not have time to embed the all-important HyperLink URL's. We had to go back in later -- after the fact, so to squeak -- and laboriously, unlazymanly, error-pronely embed the links to the explanatory documentation. But now see here Mr. AppCoder -- the links create themselves not only automagically but even retroactively -- because you and we -- should you choose to accept the mission of starting a GC AI project -- need only express our thoughts in DoubleSpeak WikiSpeak and then we can create the pertinent pre-linked wiki-pages when we get around to it.

**AI Breakthroughs For Your Information**

This anchorage is the area in which we will scoop the MSM (Main Stream Media) with the inside dope from the AI RumorMill. It was CaboBob himself who famously said that

> the AI grapevine is small, select and highstrung,
> vibrating like worldwide cobweb to the proper intrusion

but we are not the Intruder in the Dusk, we live and breathe AI from dawn to dusk. And why is it an Anchorage and not a Seattle or a Silicon Valley? It's because every header on these GC wiki-pages is automagically a URL AnchorTag. http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/wiki/WebLog#fyi is what you are reading right now for your information.
