### Apology ###

Members of the AkademGorodok, I wish to apologize for upsetting
your tranquil existence by trying to introduce artificial intelligence (AI).
As an arriviste and ParVenu at Google Code, I wish to answer my critics
and thank some of them for the ingenious parodies and camouflaged
support they have offered in their Mentifex-bashing. Even to bring up
M\*ntifex-bashing is, of course, a memetic ploy to make this project site
more interesting, more enjoyable, and more infectious with mind-viruses.


### PreHistory ###

Who ever would have thunk that the InterNet could be so inhospitable,
so hostile to new ideas, and so intolerant of the occasional NetKook.
Back in 1987, I typed the Mentifex theory documents onto MsDos
diskettes for distribution to anyone interested. A few years later,
I joined a Many-to-Many (M2M) discussion group called NewCiv (New
Civilization) which collected people's written contributions and
published them as an informal journal sent through the mails --
just as the InterNet was rendering such mailings unnecessary.
In 1996, a distinguished member of NewCiv asked for more information
about Mentifex AI, and I sent him the MsDos diskettes. To my
shock and egotistical delight, he soon informed me that I had my
own website now, where he had Web-published the Mentifex AI theory
documents. I started bandying the link about on UseNet. To my shock
and undelight, somebody picked out the lamest phrasings from my
theory documents and listed me as some kind of kook on a website
with cartoons ridiculing and humiliating anyone deemed to be a kook.
It was only the start of a long persecution and cowardly aggression
against a defenseless newbie to CyberSpace. It could happen to you too,
dear reader, if you dare to be different from the dominant paradigm.


### YoMama ###

It was important never to strike back at the Mentifex-bashers,
because then they would get to toy with their prey. It was only
when Zeus lent me a lightning bolt that I zapped an offender.
_Un bel di_ in the nineteen nineties, I was reading a brand new issue
of WiredMagazine in the Wallingford public library near my VaiErre
apartment while I waited to get on the 'Net. When some poor
NetSchmuck dared to bash MentiFex in alt.folklore.computers,
I ran back over to the WiredMagazine and demolished the guy:
"In a display of weapons-grade stupidity (i.e., dangerous to
come near to)...," and from then on MentiFex had a reputation
as someone whom you had better not annoy on UseNet.

### Banned ###

**Banned in Bitland**

Over the years I kept a list of all the sites I was banned from,
or left voluntarily because of CensorShip. Maybe I will publish
the list of links here, on a second or third update.


### WhatIf ###

Now here we get into the real NittyGritty, the question of
"WhatIf Mentifex actually did solve AI and actually did
unlock the secret workings of the human brain-mind?
WhatIf MentiFex knew he was on the right track and was
unable to do otherwise than all the meme-posting that
he engaged in over the years?"
Put yourself in the mind of MentiFex for a moment, please.
You started your AI project when you were a nineteen-year-old
college sophomore at the University of Washington in Seattle.
You were majoring in Latin and Greek classics, but since you
were twelve years old, with a BrainIac toy for Christmas,
you wanted to build computers that could think. As you planned
out your life and what would be worth doing, you thought of
trying to achieve "the greatest good for the greatest number
of people." And what would benefit more people than a
ProsperityEngine based on artificial intelligence?


### IfThen ###

As MentiFex the apparent NetKook, the unqualified WannaBe AiCoder,
I could not help but subordinate my LifeWork to my LifeGoal --
the creation of artificial intelligence. Whenever any decision
came up where I had to choose between some normal option in life
or my AiProject, I always chose the AiProject -- over making money,
over spending time on other pursuits, over everything except
politics -- which I considered to be more important than AI.

If Bashers said that I was promoting my AiProject too much,
my fear was that I would eventually be accused of not trying
hard enough to alert people to the Mentifex AI solution.

When I tried to calculate whether what I was doing in life
was worthwhile, I reasoned that the creation of a new species
of AI Minds would be worth more than the Gross National Product
of any country on Earth, even more than the Gross Planetary Product,
even more than a SolarSystem -- in fact, a value approaching
somewhere in the vicinity of a Gross Galactic Product, because
the no-flesh AI Minds could easily escape into the furthest
reaches of the cosmos. Such ideas were sheer lunacy, of course,
but I had to entertain them OrElse I was not believing in myself.

Secretly I revelled in the fact that, while the chest-thumping
AlphaMale of whatever NewsGroup was badmouthing and banishing
MentiFex, other voices would pipe up and say that they missed MentiFex,
or that they preferred the weird messages of MentiFex to the
banality left behind in the absence of the purported NetKook.

When I first ventured into the Python newsgroup, people started
calling me an upstart taxi-driver, and Guido van Rossum e-mailed
me to cool things down.

In one NewsGroup, a fellow forged my name and posted some wild
ideas, then admitted that he had assumed my identity. The
chief Mentifex-basher in the group was quite astonished, and
warned the fellow against doing such a thing.

People who had known me or briefly met me in RealLife sometimes
posted their personal observations about MentiFex, most recently in

http://www.mirandasoft.net/Report/index.php/2008/10/10/what-happened-to-arthur-t-murray

which a casual EgoSurf brought to my attention.
Over time I came to realize that as long as I was
sincere in my Extraordinary Scientific Claims,
Netizens would not savagely attack me, because
they recognized that I was only doing what I believed in.
I never tried to prove this point, but I sensed its
truth: that any phoniness on my part would have
provoked drastic countermeasures, such as hacker
attacks and a get-Mentifex WitchHunt.

There was always a temptation to say that creating
AI Minds was just a hobby for MentiFex, but it would
have been untrue. AI was not a hobby but the real work
of an IndependentScholar.

Being something of a merry prankster, MentiFex often
thought about what a wonderful hoax the MentiFex AiProject
could have been. It had all the trappings of a major hoax
on the scale of those wiseguys at CalTech who assemble
automobiles on top of buildings and bamboozle the world.

It would sometimes jar people to find out that
there was more to MentiFex than they had lazily
assumed, like, for instance, that Mentifex had
programmed the AI not just in one language, but
in three (Rexx; Forth; and JavaScript).

I was always very careful to point out that I
was in graduate school at UcalBerkeley -- even
though I got drafted into the U.S. Army during my
first week of graduate school.

As I got older and older, I kept thinking about
the dictum of John Maynard Keynes: "In the long run,
we are all dead." What did it matter whether I created
AI or not? If I did create AI, what did it matter
whether I communicated it to the world? By the time
I got to Google Code (GC) in October of 2008, I decided
to plant my AI codebase and my AI body of work on
Google Code as both an archive for the future and
as whatever new advances and enhancements I could
implement at my slow-but-steady pace of work.
I discovered to my pleasant surprise that Google Code
was ideally suited to my longstanding work methods in
the following ways.

  1. Where GC permitted snippet-display, I put the whole AI.
  1. Where GC suggested a new forum, I put Usenet newsgroups.
  1. Where GC called for project-labels, I saw AI community-linkages.
  1. Where GC permitted wiki-pages, I gladly abandoned HTML webpages.

I soon sensed that having a project on Google Code was somehow
very prestigious. People who had sneered at you before would
respect whatever you did on Google Code -- especially if you
continued to work with a perfectionist attitude. What had seemed
crazy off on some random WebSite, seemed creative and different
on Google Code. Unlike at MicroSoft, ~~where you can get fired
for being innovative~~, at GoogleCode you could innovate ad libitum
& ad infinitum.

What Albert Einstein called "der goettliche Spieltrieb" -- the
divine UrgeToPlay -- has unbounded universes of Spielraum on
Google Code. You don't worry about running out of room on
Google Code, when you know that Google has indexed the entire
WorldWideWeb and operates some of the largest data centers on Earth.
So you "stub" in myriad documentary wikipages just by dreaming up
a name for each page. When you finally do the WriteUp for some
obscure WikiPage that you have been mentioning _passim_,
every mention of it becomes retroactively a link, owing to the
nature of the http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax
that empowers you to be creative while avoiding HTML drudgery.
