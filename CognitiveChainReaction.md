### Definition ###

A cognitive chain reaction (CCR) in a nascent AGI can be
defined as a series of three or more natural-language
thoughts which, in the absence of cognitive distractions,
enter into an apparently infinite loop. By the process of
SpreadingActivation, each thought in the loop leads to the
next thought, which in turn leads to the next, and to the
next, and so on, _ad infinitum_.

### Attainment ###

Long after the nascent AGI has achieved QuIckening,
and shortly after the AI Mind has achieved
GenerationOfThought, an AGI coder will induce a cognitive
chain reaction by entering a series of looping ideas such
as the following.

```
Cats eat fish. 
Fish eat bugs. 
Bugs eat germs. 
Germs kill cats. 
```

Upon entry of the last of the looping thoughts, the AGI
will associate from the last word entered back to the start
of the loop, and will begin an endless repetition of the
loop.

### Purpose ###

The cognitive chain reaction serves mainly as a
troubleshooting device, to make sure that after changes to
the AGI source code, the AI Mind is still able to think.
Rather than labor to dream up items of novel input to test
the AGI, the programmer enters a tried-and-true series of
looping thoughts for a quick assurance that the associative
mechanisms still work properly.

The actually quite mundane purpose of the cognitive chain
reaction is not to achieve any sort of gee-whiz "wow!"
effect, but simply to verify that the AGI can think in a
repeatable set of circumstances.

### Upshot ###

In practice with the MindForth AGI, while being a valuable
diagnostic tool, the CCR has at times generated weird but
still acceptable results. Until the final thought in the
loop is entered, the AGI typically greets each new idea
with a question, such as "BUGS...WHAT ARE BUGS?"
Such a response is actually quite sophisticated, because
the AGI starts to generate a thought about "BUGS"
but does not know any verb for completion of the thought.
A module kicks in to ask a question about the new concept
about which the AGI has no data in its KnowledgeBase.

Because the chain of thought spreads or loops only if there
is sufficient activation to keep it going, sometimes there
is a kind of conceptual "hiccup" in the infinite loop,
where the AGI pauses to ask a question about one of the
words and then answers its own question by continuing the
loop. To the AGI programmer, such behavior is an indication
that the pre-programmed parameters of conceptual activation
may need some tweaking or refining. Typically, the coder
is so eager to get on with other tasks that the tweaking
is put off for a later date.

Another weird result occurs when the AGI cannot recognize
a word like "fish" as being in the plural. The AGI will
tend to say "FISH EATS BUGS" as part of the loop,
instead of "FISH EAT BUGS." But the loop continues.

If you are demonstrating MindForth or a similar AGI in
ScienceMuseums or at a robotics club, it is instructive to
show that that the cognitive loop may be interrupted at
any time by novel input from a human user.
