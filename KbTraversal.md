### Purpose ###

The module of KbTraversal serves two main purposes:
  * Making the AI more interesting to interact with;
  * Rousing the AI from a flatliner braindead state.

### Operation ###

The ReJuvenate module calls KbTraversal if there has been no
user input since the last call to ReJuvenate. The presumption
is that the AI needs to think new thoughts by activating
concepts in the EnBoot English bootstrap sequence of
innate knowledge. This technique may need further refinement
if the AI tends to get so absorbed in its own thoughts that
any invocation of KbTraversal constitutes an interruption
of thought and a derailing from a train of thought
worthy of preoccupation in its own right. We do not want
involuntary KbTraversal to become the robot analog of
ElectroShockTherapy in humans.

The original idea with KbTraversal was that it should
traverse the KnowledgeBase (KB) of accumulated ideas and reactivate
ideas that had fallen into desuetude. Since there was always
the possibility that a human user had introduced
typographical errors or outright nonsense into the AI KB,
and that KbTraversal could save the wrong ideas from the
normal oblivion of the oldest memories in ReJuvenate,
KbTraversal was implemented on 3.SEP.2008 with a range
of traversal restricted to the carefully composed knowledge
statements of the EnBoot sequence. Since KbTraversal
reactivates only a single concept and not a whole idea,
user input in the lifelong memory space may still play
a role in what the AI Mind thinks at the behest of
KbTraversal, but there is less danger of an item of
nonsense being reactivated, since the emerging thought
starts out from one of several subject concepts
presented to the Mind on a rotating basis as
pre-ordained by the AI programmer.

KbTraversal is not a natural mind-module but
rather it is an especially artificial feature beyond the ordinary
mind-emulation of artificial intelligence. The KbTraversal module
is launched or invoked by another especially artificial module,
the ReJuvenate module which performs an operation not available
in natural human minds. These unnaturally artificial modules are
necessary because the primitive AI Minds do not have enough memory
for a long mental life-span (in the case of the ReJuvenate module),
and because the lack of sensory input from robotic embodiment makes
a disembodied AI Mind tend to lapse into waiting for human input
rather than following its own internal chains of meandering thought.
