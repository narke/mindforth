### Introduction ###

The input stream to an AiMind will sometimes contain a word which can have two or more meanings. In order to make sense of its input, the AI must disambiguate the word at issue, that is, comprehend the word in its most appropriate meaning.

MindForth uses SubConscious mechanisms for disambiguation. If a sentence comes in such as, "The river has a fork," then the AI must decide whether the inputting entity is talking about a table utensil or a branching of the water-flow in a river. Because the SpreadingActivation of MindForth is based on conceptual activation attaining a MovingWave peak level and then dropping from ConSciousness down through the SubConscious into a quiescent level, the SubConscious concepts cooperate or collaborate to direct and steer the chain of association to the correct interpretation of a word requiring disambiguation. If a concept of eating were near the word "fork" in the input stream, then subconscious associations would partially activate the idea of "fork" as a table utensil to be used in the act of eating. When the word "river" occurs in proximity to "fork", subconscious associations will partially activate the idea of "fork" as a branching in the river.
