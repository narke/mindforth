### Purpose ###

The TuringTest module serves as a human-computer InterFace between the AI Mind and one or more human users. Its purpose is to provide avenues of communication between man and machine. In the most primitive AI Minds, the keyboard and the screen of a computer are the main InterFace. The tactile keyboard serves as a substitute for auditory input, and the monitor screen serves as a substitute for voice output -- unless speech synthesis is channeling output through a loudspeaker or headphone.
Earlier in AiEvolution, the same mind-module was called HCI for Human-Computer Interaction, before the module names were modified to serve as clickable links on the wiki-pages of the AI documentation. Renaming HCI as TuringTest serves the purpose of making users and coders aware of the well-known test for AI functionality named after the AI pioneer Alan Turing.

### Function ###

The SeCurity module calls the TuringTest module as one of potentially myriad operations affecting AI security. Since the TuringTest operation gives outside agents access into the AI Mind, the AI and the human user are mutually vulnerable to malicious intentions during the operation of the TuringTest. In [MindForth](http://www.nlg-wiki.org/systems/Mind.Forth) and the [German Wotan AI](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GX2B8F0), the TuringTest module protects against liability by announcing that there is no warranty for the free AI source code. MindForth and Wotan also state the date and time that the AI Mind came to life, for inclusion during TranScript mode and for the purpose of any contest to see which AI Mind installation is the oldest or has been running the longest. MindForth and Wotan may display instructions for the user on-screen, while the JavaScript AiMind and Dushka programs present checkboxes for the user to click or unclick for a choice of display modes.

Since the JavaScript AI Minds in English and in Russian are flashier and more graphical than the bare-bones robot AI of MindForth and Wotan, there is more leeway for improvisation and razzle-dazzle effects in the JavaScript tutorial programs. Ambitious AI coders in any programming language have the opportunity and the challenge of graphically depicting even the most subtle of mental phenomena occurring in the artificial intelligence, such as the branching filaments of spreading activation and the volatile surfacing of concept and ideas in the artificial ConSciousness.

### Troubleshooting ###

The visibly operating TuringTest InterFace module is somewhat easier to troubleshoot and debug than the more hidden majority of AI mind-modules, because any glitch or software error will tend to show up immediately. Typical problems may involve timing where the [rsvp](http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/wiki/var#rsvp) variable is counting down too quickly if the host computer has an extremely fast central processing unity (CPU). The AI coder or installation supervisor may have to adjust the pertinent values.

More subtle problems may arise in connection with the happenstance timing of when a human user begins entering input into the AI Mind or how fast or how slow a user tries to communicate across the keyboard. Once again, the AI coder-in-charge may need to tweak some values not only in the TuringTest module but possibly in other modules involving input and output.
