### Welcome ###

This WikiPage is your guide to the MindForth AI project and a
bulletin board of explanatory information to alert you to
some administrative policies which cause MindForth to be
different from your typical OpenSource software project.


### Code ###

The free AI source code is being released as a ForthMindTextFile at

http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/wiki/ForthMindTextFile

for the following reasons, ranked from most to least important.

  1. AI evolution demands forking the code into maximum variegation.
  1. Forth programs are executable scripts, not compiled source code.
  1. The MindForth AI project originates from a "Poor Man's AI Lab" with hardware too obsolete for handling source-code data-transfers.
