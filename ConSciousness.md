MileStones MovingWave SubConscious

### Synopsis ###

The [milestone](MileStones.md) of consciousness is not a goal in itself,
but rather an emergent phenomenon in AGI due to the nature of
the beast. Consciousness serves a purpose, and is therefore
evolutionarily mandatory. The purpose of consciousness is to
enable the existence and operation of the SubConscious.


### Subconscious ###

In those forms of artificial general intelligence (AGI) which aim to
be an actual mind and not merely a vaguely intelligent piece of
software, a reliance upon SpreadingActivation as the mechanism
of thought entails an elaborate quasi-neuronal machinery for the
regulation of levels of conceptual activation in the AGI MindGrid.
As a MeanderingChain of thought rides each crest of
SpreadingActivation, the activation of each concept briefly
peaking in consciousness must not fall immediately to zero after
meeting the searchlight of attention. Instead, the activation of
each cresting concept must degrade slowly enough and gracefully
enough to keep the concept briefly available in case twists and
turns in the chain of thought should summon the concept back into
the glaring spotlight of awareness.

The subconscious mechanism of intelligence keeps ideas ready to be
thought. If all concepts were either at full conscious activation
or at zero activation, fine nuances of thought and the dwelling on
a topic of thought might be impossible. Not only is the truth
shades of gray instead of being black and white, but thought
itself is a ruminative, digressive process. As Mister Spock
once said, "Logic is a bird aloft in the wind," and likewise
thought is a tweet which soars aloft into consciousness and
falls not immediately to ground but rather flutters and flits
from one topic to another in almost a random pigeon-walk.
