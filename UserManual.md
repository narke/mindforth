### Overview ###

Mind.Forth -- the software of an artificial robot Mind written
in the Forth programming language -- became a genuine artificial
intelligence as a result of a sudden AI breakthrough on 7 June 2006.
However, Mind.Forth did not become AI-Complete until 22 January 2008.
The breakthrough -- clearly visible in Tutorial mode -- made Mind.Forth
able to think logically and not output spurious associations of gibberish.
Is it for real? Is it genuine artificial intelligence? You be the judge. You be
the early adopter. On some clunky old MS-DOS machine, get Mind.Forth
up and running ( potentially forever) for all to see and judge. Go into the source
code, if you like, and carve your name into the on-screen messages for users.
Show it to some high-potential, low-achiever who claims to be ultra-intelligent
but never does anything ultra-productive. Then hold onto your hat, and
welcome to the Technological Singularity.

### Operation ###

After the basic functionality of the AI Mind has been tested,
we advance to probing its more sophisticated features and
possibilities. Some of these features are just getting their
foot in the door of AI operation. Their implementation is
deepening and strengthening to match how we describe them
in the User Manual. For example, we work towards machine
ConSciousness in Mindforth by teaching the AI things about
itself and by trying to steer the AI into chains of thought
leading to self-discovery, self-knowledge and self-awareness.

The Forthmind has long been able to distinguish between the
word "you" used in reference to itself and the word "you"
which it uses to address another mind in the environment.
Coming in from the outside world, the word "you" activates
the concept of "self" or "I" in Mindforth.

More recently, on 20 April 2009 to be exact, MindForth became
able to answer the question "Who are you?" with a statment of
its knowledge about itself. Since Mindforth did not yet know
its own name, its typical answer was, "I am I." But just to
answer a who-are-you question was a MileStone of achievement
for Mindforth. In preparation, the AI had to be programmed to
handle verbs of being, such as "am" and "is" and "are".
Then the AI software needed a special mechanism to deal
with interrogative words such as "who" and "what" and "where"
and "why". So the who-are-you question of three words involves
three special abilities for the AI to comprehend and answer
the question: activation of "I"; knowledge of verbs of being;
and perception of "who" as a special word triggering a response.

As you teach Mindforth things about itself and you tease out
answers in pursuit of a demonstration of self-awareness, you
may need to see Mindforth installed in a robot with complex
sensory input and motor output before you witness a convincing
display of self-awareness. ConSciousness requires the operation
of a "searchlight of attention" that explores not only the world
around the AiMind but also the AiMind itself as a distinct entity
in the world. An informational loop is established going from
the AiMind through its output motorium to external objects and
through the input sensorium back into the AiMind. You as a
human being have that same loop in support of your own
ConSciousness. You have perhaps heard of "sensory deprivation
chambers" which interfere with human consciousness and sanity.
Mindforth without robot EmBodiment may be in a condition
equivalent to a sensory deprivation chamber. The spirit is
willing for ConSciousness, but the flesh is weak, so to speak,
if there is no artificial robot body to flesh out the AiMind.

For the major AiTree modules in MindForth there is a wiki-page
with a DeBug section on how to diagnose and correct problems
and malfunctions in the AI software.

##### Getting help #####

For immediate help in dealing with the Forth programming language,
you may enter the #forth channel of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and
ask a question of the Forth experts in residence. Visit
http://www.mibbit.com and click on "Start chatting now >>"
to launch the screen with the option of "Browse IRC Networks."
Type in "Forth language" and click the "Find channels" button.
You should see #forth@irc.freenode.net among the first two or
three pages of results of the search. You join the #forth
channel simply by clicking on #forth@irc.freenode.net and
you are immediately presented with a place to type your
chat messages at the bottom of the screen. Introduce
yourself, but play it safe by not giving out any personal
details. You may type in /nick yournewnick as a command
to change from your entry nickname to your favorite nickname.
When you are done chatting about Forth, you may enter the
/quit command to leave the #forth IRC channel.

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth on Usenet
is where you may ask or answer questions about MindForth
and check back for responses as time goes by -- not so
immediately as in the #forth Internet Relay Chat channel.

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/win32forth/messages is
a discussion group devoted specifically to the Win32Forth
dialect in which MindForth is programmed and in which
http://aimind-i.com is programmed.

#### Shutdown ####

At any time, the human user may press the [Esc(ape)] key to
stop the Mind.Forth software, which will show some instructions
about what to do next in the Forth window. Entering "bye" in the
Forth window shuts down the Forth programming environment,
leaving the MS-DOS window. Entering "EXIT" in MS-DOS shuts down
MS-DOS. To shut down the personal computer (PC), clicking first on
the "Start" button and then on the "Shut Down..." option should
gracefully allow the computer to be turned off when all is ready.

### ReSources ###

As the User Manual grows by accretion of new details in keeping
with new functionality being added to MindForth, older manuals of
older versions of MindForth may be worth consulting to shed light
on how an AI Mind feature came to be or how the uses of MindForth
have changed over time. Sources of older manuals include the following.
