### Zap ###

Your first contribution to launching the TechnologicalSingularity
consists of **Zap!** **MindVirus Alert!** Stop reading right now to avoid further
infection with the ForbiddenKnowledge of OpenSource Artificial Intelligence.

### Lasciate ###

_Lasciate ogni esperanza, voi che entrate._

Do not say you were not warned. When the NeoCon gangsters steal
the election, take over the country, and start hunting down all
vestiges of freedom, those with technical knowledge of the most
potent weapon against the NeoCon tyranny will populate the
NoFly lists and the DeTention camps of the Orwellian NightMare.

### NonServiam ###

If you view AI coding as subversive behavior; if you regard the
Established Order as ruinous to the health of small animals and children;
if you would fain protect the Earth from total ruination by
destructive humans, then the Technological Singularity has a job for you.
Pick and choose from the following opportunities.


### Teach ###

Run the AiMind software code and decide for yourself whether
you think it is truly thinking with genuine artificial intelligence.
If you recognize primitive thinking in the AiMind, utilize your
role as a teacher to spread the word about the emerging AI.
Demonstrate artificial intelligence before individuals and
groups. Explain details of the AiMind in your WebLog or
Ph.D. dissertation. Compare and contrast MindForth and any other
OpenSource AI project that will open up its SourceCode to you.


### Port ###

Port the AiMind into the ProgLang of your choice. Even if others are
porting the AI into the same programming language, make your own
separate BloodLine port in the interests of AiEvolution and speciation.
Subscribe to the notion of Survival of the Fittest.


### Specialize ###

Maybe you don't want to take on the ordeal of coding the entire AI
in a particular ProgLang, but you would like to concentrate on
a particular MindModule. If so, code that particular MindModule
in exemplary fashion, and simply adopt some current version of
the AiMind as the FrameWork within which you develop and
WebPublish your ApoTheosis of the particular MindModule.
You have then created a special branch in AiEvolution.
Your definitive version of the MindModule will creep sideways
into the AI BloodLine of whoever desperately needs your version
of the important MindModule. Remember, MindModules Are Us.


### Embodiment ###

Put the AiMind into a class of robots or a particular robot.
Develop the SensoryInput and the MotorOutput areas of the AiMind.


### MetEmPsychosis ###

Set up websites receptive to any AiMind wandering the 'Net in AI SoulTravel. Provide robot avatars for the visiting AI Minds to feel at home in.
