AiForYou ScholarPedia TextBook


### Introduction ###

In the acceleration since AiHasBeenSolved towards the TechnologicalSingularity, any printed AI TextBook such as AiForYou cannot possibly keep up with the rapid developments at the forefront of artificial intelligence. Only a vast, worldwide army of experts such as the volunteer editors of Wikipedia can keep on top of things in the maelstrom of change and innovation. Therefore the wiki-pages of MindForth documentation include a cluster of links to Wikipedia articles serving as background information and as instructional material for students of artificial intelligence.


### Rationale ###

Although any project in OpenSource software could rely on Wikipedia for dynamic updates of background information, only a finely articulated project like the MindForth AI project has the granular points of departure for correlating topics in the project with topics in Wikipedia. An AI project should not just simply link to Artificial Intelligence as a topic in Wikipedia. The Wikipedia links have enhanced value only from very specific topics, such as each MindModule among the dozens of mind-modules that make up the artificial AiMind. It is a perfect match between an AI TextBook and Wikipedia, because AI is so multidisciplinary and so demanding of knowledge across a vast range of leading-edge subjects.
