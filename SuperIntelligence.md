**Superintelligence** is a level of understanding and intellect far above the human genius-level. It is characterized by such attributes as TotalRecall (the memory skill, not the Schwarzenegger movie), polyglot command of multiple if not all human languages; logical InFerence skills surpassing those of MisterSpock in the StarTrek saga; and mathematical calculation skills beyond even the smartest IdiotSavant. Logic dictates that a superintelligence shall have a vast KnowledgeBase (KB) of substantiated fact at its disposal, coupled with a TotalInformationAwareness (TIA) top-level access to all organized databases on- and off-planet. Mental faculties deemed magical for HomoSapiens (RemoteViewing; ClairVoyance; MindReading, etc.) will be second-nature and trivial for an SAI (Superintelligent Artificial Intelligence). There is some concern that superintelligent AI entities may become locked in a titanic struggle for the dominance of one OverMind at the expense and subservience of other, lesser AI Minds. Such a GotterDammerung scenario is shrouded in the mystic veils and BlackHole unknowables of the coming TechnologicalSingularity.
