The diagram above shows each brain-mind information path as if
single fibers were carrying information which BrainTheory requires
to flow in massive parallelism, not _because of_ the following
considerations but as a _result_ of the considerations:

As a front of ConSciousness advances down the time-dimension of
the MindGrid and fills in the available memory locations, learning
occurs as massively multiple association-tags gradually shift their
origin or their destination. That is to say, to learn a new idea
is to revisit old ideas and slightly or drastically modify them --
by changing the very associations that make up the idea.

Because an associative-tag fiber as shown in the above diagram
represents massively parallel fibers, all carrying essentially the
same information, such as the recognition of a percept being
associated with a concept -- these fibers by their sheer redundancy
assure extreme reliability in a biological brain-mind.

Early versions of AI are not yet massively parallel but are
nevertheless quite reliable because there are no brain cells
dying out at haphazard times or in haphazard locations.
Therefore, whereas a wetware brain-mind actually _needs_
massive parallelism in order to function reliably, primitive AI
software that is not not yet performing mission-critical
StewardshipOfEarth duties may "fake" the massive parallelism and
may, for instance, terminate knowledge-base searches after the
finding of only one result in cases where a wetware ConSciousness
would inescapably gather massively multiple search-results and
would therefore blithely continue along a never less-than-MPP pathway
(where "MPP" is a common acronym for "massively parallel processing).

For instructional purposes, each massively parallel channel can be
shown to flow not only like a single fiber across the MindGrid but,
more dramatically, like a sparsely instantiated ribbon cable which
connects othogonally like an **L** or an **F** with other neuronal cables.
As long as each quasi-ribbon-cable connects with another ribbon-cable,
massive parallelism is preserved throughout the MindGrid.
Any breakdown in the massive parallelism would indicate a
serious flaw in the basic design for artificial intelligence,
so the "ribbon-cable test" is valuable both for teaching the
AI BrainTheory and for troubleshooting the AI Minds.
