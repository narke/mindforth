### Purpose ###

The Main Loop is an area of program code that cycles over and over.
Whereas a MasPar (massively parallel) Mind would have all its parts
trying to operate simultaneously, the early, non-MasPar exemplars
of MindForth simulate massive parallelism by running each separate
module for a brief time so that the "state, operator and results"
from one MindModule may soar into the next MindModule in
the proper sequence for cognition towards a goal. Thus the
SensoryInput module collects PerCeption data which may trigger
an EmotiOn that will influence the otherwise pure reason of the Mind.
With or without emotional influence, the ThInk module
[subconsciously](SubConscious.md) establishes levels of certainty in belief
about goals and values. The resulting MindSet is an emergent mechanism
of FreeWill or volition, which in turn isses commands for the MotorOutput
module of the Mind.

The Main Loop is a form of artificial life (alife). By looping
constantly like a human heartbeat, it keeps the AiMind alive --
except for death by misadventure. The ReJuvenate module is
another loop that cycles through memory space, discarding
old, unused memories to make room for new memories.
