## Function -- what the BeVerb module does ##

The BeVerb module is part of the MindExpansion beyond the
ProofOfConcept AI, which could think only in the format
of subject-verb-object (SVO). In the SVO syntax, a transitive
verb mediates the relationship between a subject operating on
a direct object. The KnowledgeBase of even a simple AI may
contain numerous propositions stated in the SVO format.
In the ProofOfConcept Forthmind, a chain of SVO ideas may
cause a looping sequence of repetitive thoughts, such as
the following.

> Cats eat fish.

> Fish eat bugs.

> Bugs eat germs.

> Germs kill cats.

> Cats eat fish...

The performance of the AI in learning the above ideas and in
thinking them in a potentially infinite loop was a useful tool
in debugging the AI software and completing the ProofOfConcept
phase.

In the MindExpansion phase of AI development, the VerbPhrase
module must permit the AI Mind to think not only with
transitive verbs of action but also with intransitive verbs
of being. It is more difficult for an AI programmer to get
the AI to think with verbs of being rather than with verbs
of action, because it is hard to implement the factors and
reasons for VerbPhrase to use a verb of being. Typically
a human user may cause the AI to think with a verb of being
by stating a fact or asking a question like, "Who are you?"
Then it is a simple choice for the AI software to respond
with a verb of being in a sentence like "I am Andru".

However, it is not so simple for the AI to get the correct
verb-form right. Like the proverbial engineering student
who said, "Last week I did not know what an engineer was;
now I are one," the emerging AI mentality was often saying
"I are Andru" instead of "I am Andru."

The problem was ameliorated by the coding of a minor
intervention in the BeVerb module, where any attempt by the
AI to use the wrong form of "to be" after a personal
pronoun was thwarted by the software substitution of the
correct form instead of the wrong form. Since there are
only a few personal pronouns and only a few (but highly
irregular) forms of "to be", it is not hard to intercept
the linkage of the pronoun with the verb-form and force
the thinking of the correct verb-form. However, the
practice of not letting the AI use the first form it
comes up with smacks of MindControl and ThoughtPolice.
How is it justified for a MindMaker to intervene in
the FreeWill of an AI to choose whatever VerbForm it
feels like -- even a wrong one?

The answer is that the choice of a verb-form is a two-step
process. In the first step, SpreadingActivation leads the
software to select a verb such as "to be." In the second step,
which is selecting the verb-form that will express an idea,
it is legitimate for the MindMaker to code an intervention
that steers the AI to the correct verb-form, because
arriving first at the wrong verb-form in conceptual
memory was nevertheless a successful step in the right direction.
It only needed straightening out so that the AI would not
think like the proverbial engineer but rather like a
well-educated liberal arts major.
