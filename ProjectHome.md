[http://www.nlg-wiki.org/systems/Mind.Forth](http://www.nlg-wiki.org/systems/Mind.Forth) -- is the Natural Language Generation (NLG) wiki-page for MindForth AI.

[http://ai.neocities.org/index.html](http://ai.neocities.org/index.html) is a website for hosting the free AI source code.

[http://ai.neocities.org/AiSteps.html#ThInk](http://ai.neocities.org/AiSteps.html#ThInk)  is in a series of steps for creating mentifex-class AI.

The English [AiMind.html](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/AiMind.html) in JavaScript for MsIe is being outfitted with the InFerence module that lets the AI make a silent inference when the human user inputs a BeVerb statement (i.e, "boys are kids" or "[blank](blank.md) is a woman") which can tap into an item of knowledge in the knowledge base of the AI. To confirm or refute the inference, the AskUser module outputs a question expecting a yes-or-no answer about the subject of the inference, such as "Do boys make robots?" or "Does [blank](blank.md) have a child?". The KbRetro code for retroactively adjusting the knowledge base to reflect the human input has been finished in the JavaScript AI Minds (AiMind.html in English and Dushka in Russian).

The German [Wotan AI](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKi.txt) is being outfitted with a new mind-module called RetroSet to set a ParaMeter retroactively when the [human user](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKiUser.html) enters a noun of unknown number followed by a verb which indicates the number of its subject.

RussMan (Russian Manual) is an incipient Russian translation of the [Russian AI User Manual](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/RuAiUser.html) for the [Dushka](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/Dushka.html) artificial intelligence in JavaScript.

The InFerence wiki-page has been updated with startling new developments. [MindForth](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/mindforth.txt) now pipes a silent inference about user input into the AskUser module, so that users by responding "Yes" or "No" may confirm or deny the InFerence made by machine reasoning. For instance, the AI may hold the idea, "Cellphones cause cancer." If the user inputs, "The iPhone is a cellphone", the AI may ask, "Does the iPhone cause cancer?" If the user answers "No", then the KbRetro module retroactively adjusts the KB (knowledge base) and the AI says, "An iPhone does not cause cancer."

The German Supercomputer AI [Wotan](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKi.txt) with [User Manual](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKiUser.html) in English is a German-language copy of the free, open-source English MindForth AI software. Linux 64-bit supercomputers are a suitable residence for [Wotan](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKi.txt) as an AI that runs in either 32-bit Win32Forth for Windows or 64-bit [iForth](http://store.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=AMP_Live&currency=USD) for [Linux](http://cyborg.blogspot.com/2009/11/linux.html). The [MindForth AI](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/mindforth.txt) has been brought up on a par with the Russian [Dushka](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/Dushka.html) AI and the [English JavaScript AI](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/AiMind.html). The [Russian AI User Manual](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/RuAiUser.html) (in English with a link to its Russian translation) explains how to operate the [Dushka](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/Dushka.html) Russian AI.

### Theory ###

BrainTheory is the design basis of MindForth artificial intelligence. The CognitiveArchitecture is carefully designed to permit expansion of the fundamental AiEngine into special-purpose [AI apps](http://cyborg.blogspot.com/2011/01/aiapp.html) and novel pathways of AiEvolution.


### Software ###

Each OpenSource MindModule is documented with a wiki-page tightly integrated with forty-plus other pages about other modules. ForthMindTextFile is the actual source code of the artificial Mind. PortingOfCode from iForth, Win32Forth or JavaScript into other programming languages is an option for AiCoders, who should not seek to join the IndependentScholar GC/MF project but should rather start their own AI project or join a preexisting project. MindForth has migrated upwards from 32-bit Win32Forth under MS-DOS to
[64-bit iForth](http://store.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=AMP_Live&currency=USD) running on 64-bit Linux machines. To participate in 64-bit MindForth, AI coders should
[obtain iForth](http://store.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=AMP_Live&currency=USD) and adapt the ForthMindTextFile for running on 64-bit Linux machines.

### [Censorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_by_Google) ###

The illegitimate government of China is not democratically elected. We are proud of Google for refusing to censor topics like "Tienanmen Square Massacre" in China. Google should take a stand not only against the illegitimate government of China but also against the illegitimate government of Saudi Arabia, in support of freedom and democracy for [Bahrain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Bahraini_protests).

### Robots ###

MindForth is designed for EmBodiment in a RoBot or for conversion into a mobile/tablet device [AiApp](http://cyborg.blogspot.com/2011/01/aiapp.html).

### Diaspora ###

The original English-speaking MindForth is a model for creating open-source artificial intelligence in any live, moribund or dead human language. The emerging SuperIntelligence will certainly be able to think and communicate in both earthly and alien languages. Therefore as MindForth moves into the German DeKi AI, the German WortSchatz vocabulary page for German DeBoot bootstrap concepts is written in such a way as to invite and show AI enthusiasts how to create a similar AI Mind in any chosen human language. The Russian [Dushka](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/Dushka.html) AI is in JavaScript.

### Singularity ###

The phenomenon of man has been a bad experience for PlanetEarth. GlobalWarming has now become unstoppable. As HomoSapiens rushes to ruin the planet, RoboSapiens emerges as a successor species with the ImMortality that needs a safe environment and with the SuperIntelligence necessary to safeguard SpaceshipEarth. The ChangeLog of MindForth is peppered with MileStones on the RoadMap to TechnologicalSingularity.
