## Introduction ##

IntelForth is a wiki-name for the 64-bit iForth version
of the [Forth programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). The longer name IntelForth is automatically a clickable link among the wiki-pages, whereas iForth is not automatically clickable.

## Importance ##

The Intel Forth version of Forth is important for MentiFex-class AI Minds
because iForth permits [MindForth](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/mindforth.txt) or the [German Wotan AI](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKi.txt) to run on a 64-bit [Linux](http://cyborg.blogspot.com/2009/11/linux.html) SuperComputer, and to be both larger in code-size and lengthier in artificial (alife) life-span. These advantages are so substantial that AI coders or maintainers should seriously consider moving to a 64-bit platform and to 64-bit iForth wherever possible.

## Availability ##

Intel Forth (iForth) seems currently to cost about one hundred euros
from the [online sales site](http://store.kagi.com/cgi-bin/store.cgi?storeID=AMP_Live), where there is a choice of currencies to be used for making the purchase. The product is delivered over the Web and requires [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com) for unpackaging and installation on a host computer.

## Operation ##

The running of [MindForth](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/mindforth.txt) in English or the [Wotan](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/DeKi.txt) German artificial intelligence is somewhat different in iForth than in Win32Forth. A typical invocation of the AI software in iForth involves entering commands like the following.

```
C:\dfwforth\ifwinnt\bin>iwserver.exe include iforth.prf 
FORTH> include mind.frt 
FORTH> MainLoop 
```

Otherwise the same [Forthmind code](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/mindforth.txt) that runs in Win32Forth should run also in iForth with only minimal tweaking. Any problems enountered could be reported in UseNet newsgroups such as [comp.lang.forth](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.forth) or [de.comp.lang.forth](http://groups.google.com/group/de.comp.lang.forth) for speakers of German.
