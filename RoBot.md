### ConSciousness ###

A robot is the extension of an AiMind in time and space. The SensoryInput and MotorOutput modules of the AI SoftWare form a loop with the AiMind on one side and the OuterWorld on the other side. The OuterWorld feeds information through the sensory memory channels into the Mind of the robot, where emotion, thought and FreeWill combine to activate motor option memories in the MotorOutput module. When the robot initiates action, responses from the OuterWorld feed back into the SensoryInput module and cause the illusion of ConSciousness in the AiMind -- an illusion which so thoroughly fools the robot into thinking it is conscious, that it actually becomes conscious, because the illusion of ConSciousness is the reality of ConSciousness.


### Emotion ###

The EmoFlux ("flow of emotion") module enables a robot to feel emotions only if the robot body is outfitted with physiological mechanisms that correspond to the outward signs of emotion in humans, such as rapid heartbeat; tears; smiles; sweating; horripilation; and so forth. Without bodily mechanisms for emotional experience, a mind can be filled only with pure thought and not with emotion, because emotion is the splitting of thought into two components -- rational thought based on logic, and emotional thought based on the perception of physiological happenings. Logic dictates that the thinking of a robot must be distracted by physiological perception (or memories thereof) for a robot to feel emotion.

Clicking on the link above takes you to the UseNet NewsGroup where you may read and respond to information about robots. You may ask for help from others, or you may offer help to others. You may ask questions about artificial intelligence for robots, and you may supply answers to the questions asked by others.

The links above are pathways to PhotoSharing of images of robots. Persons eager to see AI developed in robots may tag their own and other images with the following snippet of HTML code copied and pasted into a Description or Comment on a Flickr image.

```
  This image appeals to AI and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/wiki/RoBot">RoBot</a> enthusiasts. 
```

Since robot-makers are hardware people and AI coders are software people, the idea is to bring together a community of AI and robot enthusiasts in the realm of PhotoSharing.
