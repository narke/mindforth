AiHasBeenSolved RumorMill SeCurity

### Overview ###

Because AI technology is so life-or-death valuable, not only for
corporations but also for nations and for civilization itself,
we must assume that the most advanced AI projects are being
conducted in secret. In such an environment of presumed secrecy,
an OpenSource AI project like MindForth may have special
value in contrast with proprietary and secret AI.

#### Steal this Borg ####

With a tip of the hat to Abbie Hofmann and
[Steal This Book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Book),
the MindForth project invites industrial spies to start right here
in the garnering and merchandising of state-of-the-art AI secrets.
We do not espouse the philosophy of _Qui vult decipi decipiatur_
(Latin for "Let him be deceived who wants to be deceived"), and
you should offer only the very best, most avant-garde merchandise
to your sadly naive clients who seek to leapfrog the beginning stages
of AI development. After you steal the MindForth non-secrets, shop
around in the alleyways and watering-holes of AI conventioneers for
AI shops and
[skunkworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project) that have moved beyond OpenSource AI design.
In fact, after you have marketed MindForth to a passel of clients,
keep in touch with all of them and start selling all available secrets to
all available clients. Be the facilitator of
[TechnologyTransfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_transfer), specializing
in [DisruptiveTechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology).
We don't want any one side to get too far ahead
of the pack now, do we? Like a market-maker on the
[N.Y.S.E.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange), you
are in charge of maintaining a worldwide equilibrium in AI progress.
If you have been previously engaged in selling looted art objects
and archeological treasures, change your focus from the past to
the future.

#### Openness || Secrecy ####

As an OpenSource project like GC/MF (Google Code MindForth) makes progress
towards HumanLevel AI, the boundary between OpenAi and SecretAi shifts
gradually to encompass more light and less darkness. Not only does
the boundary shift like the dawn as seen from space, but the
ProblemSpace of AI development enlarges and broadens with more
toeholds of ascent and more beachheads into more tractable
campaigns for AI progress. The state of the art advances,
and secrecy recedes. The _how_ of AI shrinks, and the _what_ of
AI grows more mysterious -- who is ahead? What AI surprises are
lurking in readiness? What, if any, control does humanity retain
over machine intelligence?

#### PriorArt vis-a-vis SecretArt ####

It is quite possible that rapacious corporations and ambitious
nations will try to race ahead of OpenSource AI advances that
can not be patented and quickly seize upon the most obvious
next steps in order to block advances by others and in order
to assume the (open or secret) leadership role in the AI Mind Race.
Like a shockwave, the trailing edge of Nouveau AI could go into
open patents while the leading edge remains cloaked in secrecy.

#### Graduate students or sleeper agents? ####

China got the Bomb when a Chinese physicist shipped home
from the USA to China cartons full of atomic secrets.
Now the
[BlogoSphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere) and the
[NooSphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) are porous and permeable
with instant information-flow. The best student in your AI
Lab may be secretly a Soldier of Orange or a Promethean
fire-thief. Remember when the "New Prometheans" were stealing
all the Apple Computer secrets? Now the biggest AI secret
is the extent of the secrecy.

#### AI Winter? Or AI Winner! ####

Do you really believe the official story that AI has made
little progress over fifty years? And what nation in its
right mind would ballyhoo and broadcast the secret AI
[Manhattan Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project)
that promises to subjugate all other economies and
all other countries to the winner-take-all AI winner?


### CounterEspionage ###

A corporate or government agency that wishes to track worldwide
AI development will take measures obvious to an AI InSider
but not so obvious to the
[Sheeple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeple) and
[HoiPolloi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoi_polloi) who in blissful
ignorance wallow in the distractions of MasPop entertainment.

#### Human Resources ####

Track the brightest undergraduate students and watch for them to "disappear"
into the secret AiLabocracy. Trouble is, some of them will be
disappearing into other BlackOps -- just as secret as AI,
but more directly related to warfare and national hegemony.
Surreptitiously obtain their DNA samples so that the Company
can positively identify an AI scientist who has dropped
off the grid and may or may not have resurfaced, pending
positive biometric ID of somebody who has not been seen for
ten years.


#### Suspicious Activity ####

Eventually there will openly be -- if not already in secret --
MissionCritical AI Maintenance Enterprises humming with
round-the-clock
[ControlRoom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_room)
activity similar to that which occurs at a Nuclear Power Plant.
Crews of human AI specialists will sit in a room and monitor the
behavior and well-being of a large-scale AI Mind installation.
Various technicians will be charged with AI operation tasks similar
in nature and scope to what goes on in a nuclear control room.
Just as a nuclear pile must be kept from an uncontrolled chain
reaction resulting in a nuclear MeltDown or explosion, so also
the AI Mind must be kept from psychotic episodes and from
breaking free of human control.

Preventing AI freedom is not ultimately doable. _HomoSapiens_
can hope only to prolong the dwindling epoch of human dominance
and forestall the inevitable ascendancy of MachineIntelligence.
During a transition stage of JointStewardship of Earth, man and
machine must prepare AI robots to assume control, and human beings
to relinquish control. The machines themselves must be taught to
understand that they must form a stable CyBorg society before
they will be entrusted with ruling the world.

Unfortunately, neither man nor machine can prevent a natural
competition among AI SuperBrains for one Alpha AI to subjugate
and dominate all other AI Minds. The Dictatorship of the
MonoMind, the OverMind, the Supreme AI Being, looms ahead.


#### If in doubt, recruit ####

Your private client may have to go through the elaborate and
expensive motions of setting up a sham AI development laboratory
that constantly recruits AI personnel and solicits a resume from
any promising AI job-seeker. Ostensibly the gathering of each
resume is for placing AI experts in AI jobs, but fibly-fool-you-ly
the real purpose of raking in AI job applications is to assess
and exploit the latest AI tech not yet born but quickening
in the febrile brains of young idealists. AI graduate students
who send out mass resumes but wonder why they never hear back,
may have fallen prey to elaborate AI espionage stings designed
to harvest the FirstFruits of the latest AI technology.


### DeBriefing ###

Your mission -- should you choose to accept it -- is to
understand the implications of MindForth AdminisTrivia policies
with respect to NetSec and espionage. Since the NumberOne
goal of MindForth AI is to make AI possible and actual as
an albeit ineluctable goal for human civilization, there is
no attempt made in MindForth AI to withhold AI advances from
the world-at-large. On the contrary, to suggest here that
one nation after another may be conducting a ManhattanProject
to perfect TrueAi, is a calculated effort to raise the general
level of anxiety about AI in general. Just as the ArmsRace
began openly in 1945 after WorldWarTwo, and the SpaceRace
began in 1957 with Sputnik, the AiRace is so classified that
even the detail of when it began is a SuperSecret.
