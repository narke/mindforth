ConSciousness SpreadingActivation SubConscious


### Synopsis ###

The Moving Wave Algorithm (MWA) emerged within the MindForth project
in 2005 as the solution to a problem. Whereas in the earliest versions
of MindForth, activation-levels for old and new concepts had been set
according to rigid and arbitrary rules, by September of 2005 it was
becoming clear that the activation rules were too rigid. For instance,
it no longer seemed necessary to grant concepts of user input an
arbitrarily high activation-level that could swamp and override the
activation levels on the thoughts being thought internally by the AI.
The new idea was to let the peak activation-levels be "up for grabs,"
so to speak. If what the AI was thinking internally was more important
than the user input, then the user input should not dislodge chains
of thought already underway inside the AI Mind. User input should go
at least into the SubConscious but not necessarily and not always to
the very center of ConSciousness. But what should replace the rigid
rules of activation? The Moving Wave Algorithm was born in September
of 2005 as a way to make the activation rules extremely simple --
only one concept would be allowed to be exceptionally active at a time.

The MWA solved several problems simultaneously. It not only let
internal concepts and input concepts compete for the attention of
the thinking software; it also made the generation of linguistic
thought more straightforward and easier to manage. Whereas previously
all the concepts in a thought might attain and hold a high, peaking
level of activation, under the Moving Wave Algorithm each cresting
concept had to give way and lose its high activation as the next
concept in the chain of thought rose sharply upwards into ConSciousness.

The MWA also started to accentuate and emphasize the role of the
SubConscious not only in artificial minds, but perhaps also in
natural minds. When we develop elaborate ideas about the upper
levels of activation which are the realm of ConSciousness, we
also map out details of the SubConscius machinery in the middle
levels of conceptual activation.
