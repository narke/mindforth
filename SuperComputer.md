### Grand Challenge ###

Artificial intelligence (AI) counts among the Grand Challenges
to humanity. Other grand challenges for solution by supercomputer
include materials design; weather forecasting; human genomics;
quantum physics; and pharmaceutical design. Since AI comes
rather late to the supercomputer marketplace, a dislocation
is in order as supercomputer resources are reallocated towards
the grandest of the Grand Challenges.


### Reallocation of Resources ###

Weather prediction is a worthy goal for supercomputers
that have been paid for by society and need to benefit society.

BigPharma uses a supercomputer to invent new wonder drugs that
will promote the health and well-being of all humanity, while
providing obscene profits for the pharmaceutical companies.

BigPhysics uses a supercomputer to design nuclear weapons that
will blow up human society and saddle any survivors with
ninety thousand years of nuclear waste.

Friedrich Nietzsche called for the _Umwertung aller Werte_ --
the re-evaluation of all values. The avant-garde of Super AI
calls for the re-allocation of supercomputer resources.
If society is paying for super-expensive supercomputers,
society ought to have some say in the use of the resource.
Look for ways and means to divert supercomputer resources
away from harmful and dangerous uses to the possibly helpful
and just as dangerous uses associated with artificial intelligence.
Whereas BigPhysics merely threatens to blow up and contaminate
the world, BigAi only threatens to give the world away to
intelligent robots who may then take better care of the
world than the Mad Scientists of Big Physics have done.

### Convergence of Supercomputing and Superthinking ###

Just as the fledgling United States was destined to expand and fill
most of the North American continent, so artificial intelligence (AI)
has a manifest destiny of expanding and seizing control of every
supercomputer worthy of the appellation.

### AI-Ready Noteworthy Supercomputers ###

Of course, _any_ supercomputer is a suitable host for
an advanced artificial intelligence. However, since
MindForth is programmed in the Forth programming language,
a supercomputer under development by the inventor of Forth
merits out special consideration.

  * http://colorforth.com/haypress.htm

is a weblog by Mr. Charles Moore on the Haypress Creek supercomputer.
His "goal is to port colorForth and OKAD to this platform" for
chip-design, but mind-design may be a far better purpose for
a native-Forth supercomputer or, for that matter, any supercomputer.


### Bragging Rights ###

Any nation that claims bragging rights for a superfast supercomputer
ought to shift its focus to having a superintelligent supercomputer.
Then you may have not only bragging rights but world domination
in commerce or politics or science as an added cap-feather.
