### Psst ###

You may skip the WebLog of AI Breakthrough News and go directly to the following sources of AI tidbits. If the WebLog seems not to have been updated for a while, you may find an AI Breakthrough lurking among the sources listed here.

### Singularistas ###

The following oracles of AI insider info carry special weight because the webloggers are individuals heavily involved in the actual creation of artificial intelligence or AI-ready robots. These aiholics are the doers, not the talkers.

### SourceForge ###

It is worthwhile periodically to look and see what new AI projects have opened up on SourceForge. You may discover some young starry-eyed dreamer of the dream that sweeps the world. It may be someone desperately in need of the AiFunding that you or your ConSortium can provide.

### EndNote ###

At the top of this wikipage there are some hotlinks to keep things interesting by allowing immediate cruise-through to other wiki-pages. If you read the HelpWanted page and you set up your own Google Code AI project, you are welcome to adopt memetic tips and techniques from the MindForth project. Notice that the WikiPage hotlinks are chosen very carefully at the top of each WikiPage.

BlogRoll is meant to be a general listing of some AI weblogs.

IndustrialEspionage is what happens all the time on the Web.
