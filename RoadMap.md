### Across the Universe ###

This page is not a _Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_. It is
not a Baedeker for tourists. It is not a travel map free of charge
with purchase. It is more like the Crown Jewels for thieves, or
paydirt for agents of industrial espionage. It is like a gemstone
hiding in plain sight, or an IQ test based on how you react to
what you find here. If your IQ is above average but low by cosmic
standards, you will not recognize the treasure in the gazette.
If your IQ is exceptionally high, you will marvel at the audacity
of hope in AI. If you are superintelligent, then you have Been There,
Done That as far as pathways to artificial intelligence are concerned.


### Eyes Wide Shut ###

To see the world, you must open your eyes, but to dream, Stanley,
you must shut them, shut them wide. Once in a while, an AI
_agent provocateur's_ dream comes true. If you shut your eyes
and remember _2001: A Space Odyssey_, then you know that the
year came and went without the emergence of HAL the Overmind.
But now it is 2009, and someone has unfolded an AGI Roadmap at
http://agi-roadmap.org in plain sight for Magellanic Cloud
computing. Not only did they publish the Roadmap, but they
also issued a call to arms and they invited every tinker,
tailor, soldier, spy to contribute to the Roadmap. As the
Russian ambassador said in _Dr. Strangelove_: "DuryaKEE!"
(They shouldn'a done that.) In the space/time continuum of
Magellan...Mercator...Mentifex..., did they not know what
would happen when the pent-up forces of decades of waiting
for HAL got ahold of their no-holds-barred AGI Roadmap?
Q.E.D., mon fraire, Quod Erat Demonstrandum. Just as
Will Rogers never met a man he didn't like, Mentifex Wikiwiz
never met an AI wiki that he could not copy wholesale into a local
mock-up of interlocking local webpages suitable for framing
the composition and uploading of AI wiki contributions.
