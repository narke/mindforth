### InVitation ###

The Google Code MindForth (GC/MF) project needs volunteers who will
go into the #ai@irc.freenode.net chat channel and answer questions
about the technical and theoretical details of MindForth AI.

http://instituteofgeneralintelligence.tk/chat -- another Chat site.

### InstantAccess ###

You could go into #ai Internet Relay Chat (IRC) right now
via http://www.mibbit.com and commence chatting, but proper
Netiquette requires that you first lurk a bit and familiarize
yourself with topics under current discussion.

### PsyOps ###

You do not need to install a chat client on your computer.
You may simply visit

http://www.mibbit.com

and click on the item to begin chatting. When you see
the access screen for chatting, you use the "Search" function
to find and click on **#ai@irc.freenode.net** to join the ai chat.
You may at first have a random "nickname" like mib\_2x4sf2rz but you may enter
/nick yournewnick to change to the real nickname you want to have.

Be aware that your comments on #ai IRC chat are logged for ever and ever
at such websites as

http://tunes.org/~nef/logs/ai/09.06.14

in real time. In fact, you may inspect the real-time log page
by visiting an old log page and then adjust the date to today
in your Web browser. If you see AI topics being discussed that
interest you, you may use http://www.mibbit.com to jump into the discussion.
