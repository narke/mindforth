### DisClaimer ###

Only a few techniques and hardware issues require standards in AI.
For most of AI, just as for Darwinian evolution in the origin of
species, standards are counterproductive and straightjacketing.
We promulgate here only a few standards to help AI Mind designers
hasten to the point of tossing out all the rules and all the standards.


### Neuromancing the Stone ###

If we decree [64-bit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit) computing platforms
as an ideal environment for developing AI, it is not a standard set in stone.
It is avuncular advice for an incipient AI shop trying to decide
whether to adopt 32-bit or 64-bit software and hardware. If you
choose the 64-bit technology that AI is not just migrating towards
but actually _evolving_ towards, then you avoid the eventual disruption
of a change-over from 32-bit to 64-bit. You bring your AI closer
to the leap from DeskTop computer to SuperComputer.
Pragmatically, you provide your AI Mind with the practically unlimited
memory space of a 64-bit addressing scheme. It is not a standard but
a truth universally acknowledged, Jane, that information wants to be
free and AI wants 64-bit memory. Therefore an AI pioneer in possession
of a fortune will spend it on 64-bit technology.


### BridgeWare ###

Some quasi-standards in AI exist merely for convenience, not
for the strangulation of AI innovation and independence.
A case in point is the notion of robot BridgeWare as found at

  * http://code.google.com/p/robotbridgeware

on Google Code. By offering some standard interfaces between
robot AI software and robotic physical EmBodiment, BridgeWare
makes it easier for the soul of a new machine to take control
of the new machine. Before railroads in the United States were
standardized as to their track width, four or five different
measures held sway in different parts of the country. Then
standardization in railroad gauges led, a hundred years later,
to standardization in shipping containers that unified the
transportation modalities of sea and land.


### OpenCog ###

An ambitious Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) project like
OpenCog may declare its own internal standards at

  * http://opencog.org/wiki/Development_standards

for all participants to be aware of. Standards of excellence in
such a case are not standards of uniformity or monotony. We leave it
to the universities and the gaming industry to push for deadening,
anti-freedom standards that numb the mind and suppress creativity.


### BrainTheory ###

If we put forward a BrainTheory as a model of the mind for creating
TrueAi, we are not suggesting that all AI Minds should be the same.
Only commodities should have uniform standards of execution.
Competing entities, such as AI Minds co-existing in CyberSpace,
need to differentiate themselves with different features and
different abilities for the sake of progress by trial and error.
In AI, do not standardize. Instead, diversify!
