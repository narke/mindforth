### Mandate ###

As the vice-president for artificial intelligence (VP/AI), you are the CSO (Chief Singularity Officer) for your enterprise. You answer to the CTO (Chief Technology Officer), who in turn answers to the CEO (Chief Executive Officer).

You do not need to "bet the company" in your efforts to keep up with AI technology. Instead, you are "hedging your bets" by making a minimal, exploratory investment in AI.


### Personnel ###

As VP/AI, you coordinate with HumanResources to keep an eye out for job applicants who not only meet the particular requirements for a non-AI job, but who also have extra SkillSet qualities that will fortify your corporate position for a speedy ramp-up when a strong AI division becomes a matter of corporate life-or-death. (See Vinge, op.cit.) Note that "strong AI division" has two meanings: a division strong in AI, and a division working on "Strong AI". You may be heading-up a strong Strong AI division.

On the express orders of the CEO and the CTO, you have HumanResources endeavor to build up a reserve LaborPool of individuals with any of the following special AI-critical abilities in their pre-employment resume.

  * amateur roboticist
  * computer programmer
  * college degree in
    * linguistics
    * neuroscience
    * philosophy

You and the CTO will "park" people in more traditional jobs as you prepare to implement your ContingencyPlan Table of Organization for the budding AI Division. When the crunch comes, and every other leading corporation is trying to hire scarce AI talent at a hefty premium (and all the best AI talent is far away in Mumbai or Bangalore or other points east of Eden), you as the insouciant VP/AI will simply issue an invitation for targeted in-house personnel to transfer to the new Manhattan Project in the AI Division. And if you are smart (which you are), you will "leak" news of such a plan so that a lot of AI talent signs on with your corporation precisely in hopes of such a turn of events.
