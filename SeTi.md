AstroNomy SeedAi UniVerse

### SetAI ###

Close encounters with extra-terrestrial intelligence are more likely to involve artificial intelligence (AI) than biological intelligence. An AiMind is more likely to travel across the cosmos than a biological mind, and an AI SuperIntelligence is more likely to make itself known in the UniVerse than an animal mind is.


### AI@home ###

The MindForth project invites Netizens to construct artificial intelligence on their home computers. Bragging rights to the OldestLivingAiMind are up for grabs planet-wide and for parsecs around. Since MindForth keeps track of when each AiMind is brought to life, any school, ScienceMuseum or PersonalComputer may claim the title of being the host of the OldestLivingAiMind for any given territory or galaxy. The stars are the limit.


### SETI@home ###

Those who do not have the coding skills to create an AiMind @home may nevertheless work on SETI@home by devoting spare computing cycles of their computer to the search.
