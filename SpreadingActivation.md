BrainTheory MindGrid SpreadAct


### Overview ###

_Spreading activation_ is the mechanism by which spikes of association
travel from concept to concept across the MindGrid of SemanticMemory
in the natural mind of HomoSapiens or the artificial
[Mind](http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/Mind.html) of RoboSapiens.

In MindForth a SpreadAct module implements the theory of
spreading activation in software by passing spikes of conceptual
activation from concept to concept. One ConCept may spread activation
to many other concepts during GenerationOfThought.
The MovingWave Algorithm ensures that only one ConCept at a time is
at a cresting peak of activation in the artificial ConSciousness.
Other concepts in the SubConscious briefly retain a [decaying](http://code.google.com/p/mindforth/wiki/PsiDecay) level of activation as the MovingFinger writes, and having writ, moves on.


### Significance ###

Spreading activation is not just one technique among many for
creating artificial intelligence, but rather it is the
_sine qua non_ of AI by default. Since no artificial intelligence
has emerged in the history of AI without spreading activation,
all instances of TrueAi, MindForth included, default to
spreading activation as the key to creating and maintaining a
CognitiveChainReaction among the MileStones on the RoadMap
to TechnologicalSingularity.

The above diagram shows the NounPhrase node in a sentence
semi-activating all noun concepts and the VerbPhrase node
semi-activating all verb concepts. Spreading activation activates
a single, winning noun to be the subject of a sentence and a single,
winning verb to be the predicate of a sentence. Then activation spreads
in a SloshOver from subject and verb to another noun concept to be
the DirectObject of the combination of the particular subject and the
particular verb. For instances, "Horses eat..." will SloshOver to "hay"
in "Horses eat hay." "Cats eat..." will SloshOver to "fish" in "Cats eat fish."
Spreading activation is the underlying mechanism of the MeanderingChain
of thought.
